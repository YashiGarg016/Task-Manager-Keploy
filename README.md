## üóÑÔ∏è Database Used & Integration

- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Integration:** The API uses [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to connect to a local MongoDB instance at `mongodb://localhost:27017/tasksDB`.
- **Schema:** Each task has a `title` (String) and `description` (String).

**Integration Example:**
```js
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/tasksDB")
  .then(() => console.log("‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB"))
  .catch((err) => console.error("‚ùå MongoDB connection error:", err));
```

## üöÄ How to Run the Server

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start MongoDB**
   - Make sure MongoDB is running locally on your machine (`mongodb://localhost:27017`).

3. **Run the Server**
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
   The server will start on [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Interact with the API

- Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `curl` to send requests to the API.
- **Base URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

### Example `curl` Commands

- **Get all tasks:**
  ```sh
  curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/tasks
  ```

- **Create a new task:**
  ```sh
  curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/tasks \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"title":"Read a book","description":"Finish reading Atomic Habits"}'
  ```

- **Update a task:**
  ```sh
  curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:3000/tasks/<TASK_ID> \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"title":"Read two books","description":"Finish reading Atomic Habits and Deep Work"}'
  ```

- **Delete a task:**
  ```sh
  curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:3000/tasks/<TASK_ID>
  ```

## üìì Notes

- Replace `<TASK_ID>` with the actual `_id` value of the task you want to update or delete.
- The API works with `127.0.0.1` as the host. If you use `localhost` and face issues, stick to `127.0.0.1`.
- All responses are in JSON except for the delete operation, which returns a plain text confirmation.
